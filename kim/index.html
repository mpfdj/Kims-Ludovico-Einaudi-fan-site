                <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                Einaudi was born in Turin, Piedmont.[4] His father, Giulio Einaudi, was a publisher[5] working with authors
                including Italo Calvino and Primo Levi, and founder of Giulio Einaudi Editore.[6] His paternal grandfather,
                Luigi Einaudi, was President of Italy between 1948 and 1955. His mother, Renata Aldrovandi, played the piano to
                him as a child.[7] Her father, Waldo Aldrovandi, was a pianist, opera conductor, and composer who emigrated to
                Australia after World War II.[5]

                Einaudi started composing music as a teenager, first writing by playing a folk guitar.[8] He began his
                musical training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, obtaining a diploma in composition in 1982.[9] That same
                year he took an orchestration class taught by Luciano Berio and was awarded a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music
                Festival.[10] According to Einaudi, "[Luciano Berio] did some interesting work with African vocal music and did some
                arrangements of Beatles songs, and he taught me that there is a sort of dignity inside music. I learnt orchestration
                from him and a very open way of thinking about music."[1][8] He also learned by collaborating with musicians such as
                Ballaké Sissoko from Mali and Djivan Gasparyan from Armenia.[8] His music is ambient, meditative, and often
                introspective, drawing on minimalism and contemporary pop.[10]
