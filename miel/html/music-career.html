    1980s
    After studying at the conservatory in Milan and subsequently with Berio, Einaudi spent several years composing in
    traditional forms, including several chamber and orchestral pieces.[10] He soon garnered international attention and
    his music was performed at venues such as the Teatro alla Scala, the Tanglewood Music Festival, Lincoln Center, and
    the UCLA Center for Performing Arts.[11]

    In the mid-1980s, he began to search for more personal expression in a series of works for dance and multimedia,[11]
    and later for piano.[10]

    Some of his collaborations in theatre, video, and dance included compositions for the Sul filo d'Orfeo in 1984,[12]
    Time Out in 1988, a dance-theatre piece created with writer Andrea De Carlo,[11] The Wild Man in 1990, and the
    Emperor in 1991.[12] Later collaborations include Salgari (Per terra e per mare) (1995), an opera/ballet
    commissioned by the Arena di Verona with texts by Emilio Salgari, Rabindranath Tagore, and Charles Duke Jr,[11] and
    E.A. Poe (1997), which was conceived as a soundtrack for silent films.[12]

    Soundtracks
    Einaudi began using his style to compose film soundtracks in the mid-1990s. He started with two films by Michele
    Sordillo, Da qualche parte in città in 1994 and Acquario in 1996, for which he won the Grolla d'oro for best
    soundtrack. In 1998, he composed the soundtrack for Treno di panna and the score for Giorni dispari by Dominick
    Tambasco.[12]

    In 2000, he collaborated with Antonello Grimaldi on Un delitto impossibile, and he also composed the soundtrack for
    Fuori del mondo, for which he won the Echo Klassik award in Germany in 2002.[12][better source needed] After the
    release of his debut album, some excerpts were included in the film Aprile by Nanni Moretti.[12] In 2002, his
    soundtrack for Luce dei miei occhi was named best soundtrack at the 2002 Italian Music Awards.[12]

    In 2002, Einaudi won an Italian award for Best Film Score for Luce dei miei occhi.[10] AllMusic gave his score for
    the 2002 TV serial Doctor Zhivago 4.5/5 stars and published a glowing review, comparing it in skill to Maurice
    Jarre's score of the previous film adaptation.[13]

    In 2004, his soundtrack for Sotto falso nome received the prize for the best film music at the Avignon Film
    Festival.[12]

    In 2010, Einaudi wrote the music for the trailer of Black Swan.[14] His "Due Tramonti" was featured in the film I'm
    Still Here (2010), directed by Casey Affleck. His composition "Nuvole Bianche" was featured in the film Insidious
    (2010), directed by James Wan, the British TV drama This Is England 86, and in the TV series Derek (2012), directed
    by and starring Ricky Gervais. To The Intouchables (2011), the biggest box office movie in French history, he
    contributed the tracks "Fly", "Writing Poems", "L'origine nascosta", "Cache-cache", "Una Mattina", and "Primavera."
    The film This Is England featured Fuori dal mondo and Dietro casa. The British TV drama series This Is England '88
    also contained the tracks "Fuori Dalla Notte", "Solo" (a bonus track from Nightbook), "Berlin Song", and
    "Distacco".[15]

    Solo releases
    Einaudi is signed to Decca Records and is published by Chester Music Limited, part of the Music Sales Group of
    Companies.

    After the multi-media-inspired Time Out in 1988, in 1992 he released Stanze, which he had composed for harp. The
    album was performed by Cecilia Chailly, one of the first musicians to use an electric harp. Einaudi released his
    first solo piano album, Le Onde, in 1996, under BMG. The album is based on the novel The Waves by British writer
    Virginia Woolf, and enjoyed mainstream success, particularly in Italy and the UK.[12] His 1999 followup, Eden Roc,
    was also released on BMG, with shorter pieces. For the project he collaborated with the Armenian duduk musician
    Djivan Gasparyan.[12]

    His next solo piano release, I Giorni (2001), was inspired by his travels in Africa.[12] The solo piano track "I
    Giorni" was featured in a BBC promotion for arts and culture programs,[16] and attracted much interest due to Greg
    James' airing of the piece on BBC Radio 1 in June 2011. James mentioned that he found the piece therapeutic when he
    was studying at university.[17] Due to repeated airings that month, the track entered the UK Singles Chart at #32 on
    12 June 2011.[18]

    In 2003, Einaudi released the live album La Scala Concert 03.03.03, which was recorded at the famous La Scala opera
    house in Milan. His 2003 album Diario Mali is another collaboration, with Einaudi on piano and Malian musician
    Ballaké Sissoko on kora. In 2004, Einaudi released the album Una Mattina on Decca Records.[12] The 2006 album
    Divenire consists of piano accompanied by orchestra. The album also includes the artist's critically acclaimed track
    "Primavera." It was recorded by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, with Einaudi as the piano master.
    Shortly after its release, Einaudi went on tour to various places in the UK, playing both the music on Divenire and
    orchestral arrangements of his other works. The album topped the iTunes classical chart.[1]

    In October 2009, Nightbook was released. The album saw Einaudi take a new direction with his music as he
    incorporated synthesized sounds alongside his piano.[10] The album was conceived and recorded in response to the
    German painter and sculptor Anselm Kiefer, as well as an exhibit space where Einaudi performed for a gallery opening
    for Kiefer. It was also inspired by the drums and electronics of the Whitetree Project, a performing trio Einaudi
    formed with Robert and Ronald Lippok of To Rococo Rot, a German electronic group.[7] In Italy, the album went Gold
    with more than 35,000 copies sold.

    Einaudi's album In a Time Lapse was released on 21 January 2013,[19] with US and Canadian supporting tours. He also
    appeared on KCRW in Los Angeles.[20] On 17 September 2013, Einaudi performed various songs from In a Time Lapse,
    together with a new ensemble, at the annual iTunes Festival held at the Roundhouse in London. The group intimately
    rehearsed this performance in the barn of Einaudi's house.[21] In March 2016, the world premiere of a new piano
    concerto, "Domino", took place at the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.[22]
